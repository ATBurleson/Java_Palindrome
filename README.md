# Java_Palindrome
A simple Java program to check whether the string that a user enter is a palindrome compared to the original string reversed.

# What is a Palindrome:
A palindrome is when the word or sentence of choosing is equal to, i.e. spelled the same backwards as forwards.
After the user enters their string a 'for loop' can be used to increment and add each tetter ftrom the original string to an 
string variable of choosing then an 'if statement' can be use for comparing the two.
